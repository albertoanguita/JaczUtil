jacuzzi is an open source collection of utilities for Java. Some of its features are:

- Concurrency: the concurrency package provides advanced locking systems, configurable event-based timers, process speed monitoring/limiting
- IO: the io package provides a rich collection of classes for performing io operations, including simple XML serialization, a local storage API (imitating those from javascript engines), generic buffer implementations, a CSV API...
- AI: the ai package provides several knowledge inference APIs, such as finite state machine implementations, or mycin inference rules.
- Advanced Map implementations: bijective map, double-key map, auto-key map...
- Other APIs: hash-based management of files and data structures, observer pattern implementation, generic range API, parallel event queue processing API...
